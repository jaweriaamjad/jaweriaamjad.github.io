# How to Navigate This Site

Welcome. This is a **digital garden** — a collection of interconnected ideas that grow over time.

Unlike a traditional blog where posts are listed chronologically, this site is structured around **themes** and **connections**. You can read linearly, or you can follow your curiosity through the links.

## If you're new, begin here

### Understand the themes

My writing orbits five core ideas. Start with whichever resonates:

1. **[[themes/after-the-checklist|After the Checklist]]** — For those who did everything "right" and still feel unsettled
2. **[[themes/ambition-and-anxiety|Ambition & Anxiety]]** — The emotional cost of high achievement
3. **[[themes/motherhood-with-intention|Motherhood with Intention]]** — What we pass on to our children
4. **[[themes/money-as-agency|Money as Agency]]** — Financial literacy as liberation
5. **[[themes/midlife-reorientation|Midlife Reorientation]]** — Designing the next chapter with intention

### Read my story

→ **[[about|About me]]** — Who I am and why I'm writing this

### Explore the writing

→ **[[writing/index|All essays]]** — Long-form reflections, organized by theme

## How the graph works

On the right side of each page, you'll see a **graph view**. This shows how ideas connect to each other.

- **Click nodes** to navigate to related pages
- **Hover** to see connections
- **Zoom and pan** to explore the full map

The graph isn't decoration — it's a map of how these ideas relate. Over time, it will grow denser as I add more writing.

## A note on tone

I'm not here to:
- Motivate you with empty optimism
- Optimize your life into a spreadsheet
- Perform struggle or success

I'm here to:
- Think clearly about complex things
- Share what I'm learning, honestly
- Model **agency under constraint**

If that resonates, you're welcome here.

## Stay connected

This garden is being planted. New essays and notes will appear over time.

For now, pick a theme that calls to you, and begin.
