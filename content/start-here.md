# How to Navigate This Space

Welcome. This is a **digital garden** — a collection of interconnected ideas that grow over time.

Unlike a blog with posts in reverse chronological order, this site is organized around **themes** and **connections**. You can read linearly or follow your curiosity through the links.

## New here? Start with these

### The core themes

My thinking orbits five ideas. Pick the one that resonates:

1. **[[themes/after-the-checklist|After the Checklist]]** — What becomes possible when you stop proving and start building
2. **[[themes/ambition-and-anxiety|Ambition & Anxiety]]** — Moving from survival-mode drive to intentional ambition
3. **[[themes/motherhood-with-intention|Motherhood with Intention]]** — Raising grounded kids while pursuing your own goals
4. **[[themes/money-as-agency|Money as Agency]]** — Understanding wealth as a tool for freedom
5. **[[themes/midlife-reorientation|Midlife Reorientation]]** — Designing the next chapter on your terms

### Learn more about me

→ **[[about|About me]]** — Who I am and what I'm building

### Explore the writing

→ **[[writing/index|All essays]]** — Long-form reflections, organized by theme

## How the graph works

On the right side of each page, you'll see a **graph view** showing how ideas connect.

- **Click nodes** to navigate
- **Hover** to see connections
- **Zoom and pan** to explore

The graph reveals the structure beneath the content. As I add more writing, it becomes richer.

## The tone here

What you'll find:
- Clear thinking about complex topics
- Honest reflection without performance
- Forward momentum, not backward processing
- **Agency, not advice**

I'm not here to tell you what to do. I'm here to share how I'm thinking — and invite you to think alongside me.
