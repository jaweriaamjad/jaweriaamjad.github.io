# Building a life that is ambitious without being anxious

I'm **Jaweria Amjad** — an AI research engineer, mother of two, and a woman who did everything she was told would lead to success.

I finished my studies. Got married. Had children. Built a career. Earned a PhD from UCL, completed a postdoc at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, and now work in industry. 

*And yet.*

Life didn't become simpler or calmer. The checklist was complete, but the questions multiplied.

## What you'll find here

This is a space for women in midlife who are navigating **career**, **caregiving**, and **ambition** — often all at once. 

I write about:

- [[themes/after-the-checklist|After the Checklist]] — what happens when you do everything right and still feel unsettled
- [[themes/ambition-and-anxiety|Ambition & Anxiety]] — imposter syndrome, nervous systems, and redefining worth
- [[themes/motherhood-with-intention|Motherhood with Intention]] — emotional inheritance and what we model for our children
- [[themes/money-as-agency|Money as Agency]] — financial literacy as freedom, not hustle
- [[themes/midlife-reorientation|Midlife Reorientation]] — turning 40 and choosing differently

## The invitation

I'm not here to motivate you. I'm not here to optimize your life.

I'm here to **think clearly**, **speak honestly**, and **share what I'm learning** — in real time.

If you're a woman who has achieved on paper but feels quietly disoriented, you're in the right place.
