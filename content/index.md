title: Welcome
---

I'm **Jaweria Amjad** -- researcher, mother, and a woman designing her next chapter with intention.

I hold a PhD from UCL, completed a postdoc at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, and now build AI systems in industry. I've done the checklist. Now I'm doing something more interesting: **choosing what comes next**.

## What this space is about

This is where I think out loud about the intersection of **career**, **motherhood**, **money**, and **meaning** — for women who are done following scripts and ready to write their own.

I explore:

- [[themes/after-the-checklist|After the Checklist]] — what opens up when you stop chasing and start choosing
- [[themes/ambition-and-anxiety|Ambition & Anxiety]] — upgrading from survival mode to intentional drive
- [[themes/motherhood-with-intention|Motherhood with Intention]] — raising steady kids in an unsteady world
- [[themes/money-as-agency|Money as Agency]] — building wealth as freedom, not status
- [[themes/midlife-reorientation|Midlife Reorientation]] — designing the second act deliberately

## The vibe here

I'm not here to commiserate. I'm here to **build**.

Clear thinking. Honest reflection. Forward motion.

If you're a woman with credentials, responsibilities, and the growing realization that you get to decide what success looks like now — welcome. You're in the right place.
