# After the Checklist

*What happens when you do everything right — and still feel unsettled.*

---

There's a script many of us were handed. It promised that if we followed the steps — education, marriage, children, career — we would arrive somewhere stable. Somewhere peaceful. Somewhere that made sense.

The checklist was clear:
- ✓ Graduate with honors
- ✓ Get married at the right age
- ✓ Have children
- ✓ Build a successful career
- ✓ Make your family proud

I completed it. And then I waited for the clarity that was supposed to follow.

It didn't come.

## The dissonance

Achieving everything doesn't feel like arriving. It feels like standing at the summit and realizing the view isn't what you expected.

This isn't ingratitude. It's not failure. It's **the natural result of optimizing for external markers** without asking what actually sustains you.

For women from traditional backgrounds — Pakistani, South Asian, immigrant families of all kinds — this dissonance is especially sharp. We were told the checklist was non-negotiable. That deviation meant shame. That completion meant peace.

But completion doesn't mean peace. It means a new set of questions.
