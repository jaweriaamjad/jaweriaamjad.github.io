# Motherhood with Intention

*What we inherit. What we pass on.*

---

I don't want my children to inherit my anxiety-driven ambition.

I want them to inherit a **regulated nervous system**.

This single shift in framing has changed how I think about parenting, success, and what it means to raise children in a chaotic world.

## The inheritance question

Every parent transmits more than genes. We transmit:
- Our relationship with rest and achievement
- Our capacity to tolerate uncertainty
- Our emotional vocabulary
- Our nervous system patterns

Children don't learn from what we say. They learn from what we **embody**. They absorb our calm — or our chaos.

This is both terrifying and liberating. Terrifying because it means my healing work is their inheritance. Liberating because **I don't have to solve the world's problems — I just have to become more regulated myself**.

## Against checklist parenting

I was raised with a checklist. Good grades. Good behavior. Good outcomes.

The intentions were loving. The execution created anxiety.

I'm trying something different:
- Fewer performance metrics, more presence
- Less "what did you achieve today," more "how did you feel today"
- Teaching them that rest is not laziness
- Modeling that uncertainty is survivable

This isn't permissive parenting. It's **intentional parenting** — choosing what values to transmit, rather than defaulting to the ones I inherited.

## The cultural layer

For women from South Asian backgrounds, motherhood carries particular weight.

We are often expected to:
- Sacrifice without acknowledgment
- Produce accomplished children as proof of our value
- Manage households, careers, and emotional labor simultaneously
- Do all of this gracefully, without complaint

I honor the sacrifices of the women before me. But I'm allowed to parent differently. **Honoring tradition doesn't mean repeating it unconsciously.**
