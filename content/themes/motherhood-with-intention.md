# Motherhood with Intention

*Raising grounded kids while building an ambitious life.*

---

I'm raising two children. I'm also building a career, learning about wealth, and creating content. These aren't in conflict — they inform each other.

The question isn't *motherhood or ambition*. It's: **What kind of life am I modeling?**

## What I want them to inherit

Not my credentials. Not my achievements.

I want my children to inherit:
- A **regulated nervous system** — the ability to stay steady in uncertainty
- **Agency** — knowing they can shape their circumstances
- **Curiosity** — the confidence to explore without needing to be right
- **Choice** — the freedom to define success for themselves

These aren't taught through lectures. They're absorbed through proximity. Which means my own growth is part of their inheritance.

## Beyond checklist parenting

I was raised with clear metrics: grades, behavior, outcomes. The intentions were good. But metrics without meaning create anxiety.

I'm trying something different:
- Presence over performance tracking
- Emotional vocabulary alongside academic skills
- Modeling that rest is strategic, not lazy
- Showing them what it looks like to build something you care about

This isn't permissive parenting. It's **intentional parenting** — choosing what values to transmit rather than defaulting to the ones I received.
