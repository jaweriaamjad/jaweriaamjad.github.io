# Money as Agency

*Understanding wealth as a tool for freedom.*

---

I have a PhD from UCL. No one taught me how money actually works.

This is common among highly educated women — especially from traditional backgrounds. We were taught to earn. We weren't taught to build.

I'm fixing that now. Not because I want to be rich, but because **financial literacy is freedom**.

## The system, not just the hustle

Hard work matters. But hard work alone doesn't create wealth.

What creates wealth:
- Understanding systems (taxes, compounding, asset classes)
- Owning things that grow without your time
- Long-term thinking over short-term earning
- Access to information and opportunity

"Work hard and you'll succeed" is incomplete advice. **Understanding how the game works** is the leverage.

## Why this matters for women

For many women — especially from cultures where money was handled by fathers or husbands — financial agency came late, if at all.

The result: We earn well but don't build wealth. We hope rather than strategize.

This isn't a character flaw. It's a gap in education. And gaps can be closed.

## What I'm building

I started investing a few years ago. Now I'm going deeper:
- Building income that doesn't require my presence
- Understanding risk and patience
- Creating a financial foundation for the life I'm designing
- Learning what I'll teach my children about money

This isn't about hustle culture. It's about **options**. The freedom to make choices based on values, not desperation.
