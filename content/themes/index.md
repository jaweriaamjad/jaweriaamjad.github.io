# Core Themes

These are the conceptual pillars of my thinking. Everything I write connects back to one or more of these ideas.

## [[after-the-checklist|After the Checklist]]
What becomes possible when you've done what was expected — and now get to decide what's next.

## [[ambition-and-anxiety|Ambition & Anxiety]]
The difference between drive that depletes and drive that builds. Upgrading your operating system.

## [[motherhood-with-intention|Motherhood with Intention]]
Raising grounded kids while pursuing ambitious goals. What we model matters more than what we say.

## [[money-as-agency|Money as Agency]]
Understanding wealth as a tool for freedom — systems, assets, and long-term thinking.

## [[midlife-reorientation|Midlife Reorientation]]
Designing the second act deliberately. Choosing what matters now.

Each theme collects related essays and notes. As I write more, these will grow.
