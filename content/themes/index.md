# Core Themes

These are the conceptual homes of my thinking. Everything I write connects back to one or more of these ideas.

---

## [[after-the-checklist|After the Checklist]]
What happens when you do everything you were told would bring success — and life still doesn't feel complete.

## [[ambition-and-anxiety|Ambition & Anxiety]]
The emotional cost of high achievement. Imposter syndrome, nervous system regulation, and redefining self-worth beyond accomplishment.

## [[motherhood-with-intention|Motherhood with Intention]]
What we inherit, what we pass on. Raising children without transferring our anxiety to them.

## [[money-as-agency|Money as Agency]]
Financial literacy as a path to freedom — not hustle culture, but understanding how wealth and systems actually work.

## [[midlife-reorientation|Midlife Reorientation]]
Turning 40 and designing the next chapter with intention. Choosing what matters now, not what mattered then.

Each theme page collects related essays and notes. As I write more, these will grow.
