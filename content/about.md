# About Me

I grew up in Pakistan with a clear roadmap: education, marriage, children, career. I followed it — not blindly, but deliberately. I wanted to see what was on the other side.

Now I'm here. And the view is better than I expected.

## The credentials

- **PhD** in Machine Learning and Signal Processing, University College London
- **Postdoctoral Research** at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit
- **AI Research Engineer** at Zellis, building testing frameworks for production AI systems

I earned these. They opened doors. And now I'm using that foundation to build something that's fully mine.

## Where I am now

I turn 40 next year.

I've reached the point where I understand how the game works — career trajectories, financial systems, the difference between earning and building wealth. More importantly, I've developed the clarity to know what I actually want.

I work in a role that gives me flexibility. I'm learning to create income that doesn't require trading all my time. I'm raising two kids with intention, not anxiety. And I'm building a public presence around ideas that matter to me.

This isn't a pivot born from crisis. It's an expansion born from **capacity**.

## What I'm building here

I write for women in midlife who have accomplished plenty and are now asking: *What do I want to build next?*

Not from exhaustion. Not from regret. From **clarity**.

Through reflections on work, motherhood, culture, and money, I explore what it means to live ambitiously without living anxiously — to be driven and grounded at the same time.

## The support system

I have an incredible sister who has been my partner through everything. Building something meaningful is easier when you're not doing it alone. I don't take that for granted.
