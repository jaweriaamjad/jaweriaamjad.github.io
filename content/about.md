# About Me

I grew up in Pakistan with a checklist handed to me before I could question it.

*Finish your studies. Get married. Have children. Excel in your career. Aim for the stars — financial independence alone isn't enough.*

Maybe it wasn't all external. My personality had something to do with taking these things seriously. Either way, I did it. Allah was extremely kind. But I battled extreme anxiety and imposter syndrome along the way.

The goal was to achieve everything, and then life would make sense. Life would get easy.

## The reality

Life doesn't get easy.

We live in a world of constant wars, wealth inequality, and declining tolerance. Raising children in this climate is hard. And I don't want to raise mine with the same expectations I inherited.

I want them to inherit a **regulated nervous system**. Not the anxiety-driven ambition that propelled me. I want them to have **choice** — real choice — about what matters.

## The credentials (if you need them)

- **PhD** in Machine Learning and Signal Processing, University College London
- **Postdoctoral Research** at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit — exploring the intersection of neuroscience and deep learning
- **AI Research Engineer** at Zellis, developing testing frameworks for specialized AI systems

I graduated from some of the best places in the world. But credentials don't automatically translate to abundance, peace, or clarity.

## Where I am now

I turn 40 next year.

I'm at the cusp of achieving everything I set out to — and finally understanding what I actually want. How to gain financial independence in a way where I'm not just trading time for money. How to build something that compounds.

I've already started: I work at a place that doesn't require me to come in every day. I'm learning to design the next season of my life, rather than follow a script someone else wrote.

## What this space is for

I write for women in midlife who did everything they were told would lead to success — **education, marriage, children, career** — and are now asking harder questions about peace, money, and meaning.

Through reflections on work, motherhood, culture, and financial independence, I explore how to build a life that is **ambitious without being anxious**, and **grounded without being small**.
