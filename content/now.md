# What I'm Building Now

*Last updated: December 2024*

## Work

AI Research Engineer at Zellis, developing testing frameworks for specialized chatbots. It's applied, production-focused work — exactly where theory meets reality. I'm learning what makes AI systems actually reliable, not just impressive.

## This site

My first step into content creation. I've spent years developing ideas about ambition, motherhood, money, and identity. Now I'm learning to share them publicly — building the muscle of clear articulation.

## Financial education

I started investing a few years ago. Now I'm going deeper: understanding systems, building assets, thinking long-term. The goal is financial independence — not someday, but as an active project.

## Nervous system work

Learning to operate from regulation rather than activation. This isn't self-help — it's infrastructure. Calm is a competitive advantage.

## Family

Mother of two. They shape my priorities and sharpen my clarity about what actually matters. I'm raising them to be steady, curious, and free to choose their own paths.
