# What I'm Focused On Now

*Last updated: December 2024*

## Work

I'm an AI Research Engineer at Zellis, building testing frameworks for specialized chatbots in the HR and workforce management space. It's applied work — less theoretical than my PhD or postdoc — but deeply practical. I'm learning what it means to make AI systems reliable in production, not just impressive in demos.

## Building in public

This website is my first step toward content creation. I'm learning to articulate ideas that have been forming for years — about ambition, motherhood, cultural expectations, and what happens after you do everything you were told to do.

## Learning

- **Personal finance**: I started investing a few years ago and am now studying how wealth actually works — systems, opportunities, and the gap between "working hard" and financial independence
- **Nervous system regulation**: Understanding how my body holds stress, and how I can model something healthier for my children

## Family

Mother of two. This shapes everything — my time, my priorities, my definition of success. I don't want my children to inherit my anxiety. I want them to inherit steadiness and choice.

## What's next

- Launch TikTok and Instagram presence
- Write my first long-form essay: *"After I Did Everything Right"*
- Build out the themes on this site
- Connect with others navigating similar questions
